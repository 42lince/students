## Adding yourself

Students, introduce yourself via a `GITHUB_USERNAME.json` file under the appropriate [`_data/TERM_YEAR/`](https://github.com/advanced-js/students/tree/gh-pages/_data) directory, and submit via pull request. Here's an example:

```javascript
// _data/spring_2015/afeld.json
{
 "emoji": "dancer",
 "introduction": "Developer at 18F by day, dancer by night."
}
```

Using the format above, replace with your own `emoji` (choose from [this list](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/)) and `introduction`.
